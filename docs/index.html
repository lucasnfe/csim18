<h2>Welcome to CSIM 2018!</h2>

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer simulations in the context
of interactive media. Students are exposed to tools and techniques for modeling physics, agents
(behaviors), evolution, learning and social processes, in order to design expressive interactive media.
This course also covers the foundations of game ​design, including history, technology, narrative,
ethics, and theories that drive the process of making ​interactive ​games​. Moreover, students
learn programming in Lua with LOVE, which is a game engine used for all the homework assignments.
